  <b>Problem Statement</b>:<br />
   Given N integers, perform two types of queries on them-(if 1-based indexing followed)<br />
   1.  Update p-th index to q.<br />
   2.  Find the number of integers that can be represented as 2<sup>x</sup>+2<sup>y</sup> (x &ne; y, x &ge; 0, y &ge; 0) in the range [p,q].<br />
  The question was a standard update,range-sum query question on segment tree but can be solved using other data structures like Binary Indexed Tree,etc. also. <br />
